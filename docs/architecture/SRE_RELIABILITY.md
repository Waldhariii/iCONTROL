# SRE Reliability Model

- SLO/SLI definitions live in SSOT (`platform/ssot/sre/*`).
- Error budget policies define burn rate thresholds and actions.
- Canary analysis is manifest-aware and gateable.
- Restore drills and evidence packs produce auditable reports.
- Chaos toolkit runs in safe/dev mode only.
