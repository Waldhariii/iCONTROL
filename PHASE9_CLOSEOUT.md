# PHASE 9 CLOSEOUT

## Scope
- Move0: ReleaseOps invariants gate + contract + RFC approval
- Move1: CP operator surface (read-only) exposed via MODULE_CATALOG + contract tests
- Move2: SSOT surface↔route mapping invariants gate + contract test
- Move3: ReleaseOps checklist generator -> _audit only (untracked) + contract test
- Move4: Closeout evidence (this document)

## Current discipline
- Contract-first gates
- Release-train alignment via tag-set-atomic + canonical tags (RC/PROD/BASE)
- No pages métier introduced in Phase9 (operator-only)

## Next (Phase10+)
- Continue productization (tenant lifecycle, billing wiring, observability)
- Keep business pages blocked until Phase11 completion criteria are met.
